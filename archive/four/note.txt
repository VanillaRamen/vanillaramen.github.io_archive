As I am writing this, I believe this is the best my website has ever been.
But I feel the call to overhaul it once again.

Something within me calls for a rapid and revolutionary change in the way I express myself. Something within me yearns for a new way to be me. After all, I am always changing.

Reader, if you are not me, thank you for digging deep enough to find this.
If you are a stranger, I admire your tenacity for knowledge on someone so insignificant and unconnected to you as me.
Your attention is appreciated, even if it is not perceived.
Your energy sustains me as I write this, no matter how disconnected through the passage of time we are.
